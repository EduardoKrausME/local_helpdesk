## Overview
This plugin provides a ticketing system for managing support requests. It allows users to create and track tickets while enabling administrators and support teams to manage and respond efficiently.

## Features
- Creation and management of support tickets by users.
- Categorization of tickets for better organization.
- Assignment of users to specific categories to respond to tickets.
- Email notifications for new tickets and responses.
- Automated responses with the assistance of artificial intelligence.

## Requirements

Optionally, it also requires the **[GeniAI](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_geniai)** plugin. If **GeniAI** is enabled, it will support automatic response creation using artificial intelligence.
